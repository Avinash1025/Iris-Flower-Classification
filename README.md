# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective **machine learning model** to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**, using the popular **Iris dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Spam emails, phishing content, and irrelevant messages flood inboxes every day. This project uses **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **NLP** techniques to build an intelligent spam detector that classifies emails as **spam** or **non-spam**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- The dataset used is the **Iris Dataset**, available via [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) or in `Iris.csv` (included).
- It contains 150 samples with 4 numerical features and 1 categorical label (species).
